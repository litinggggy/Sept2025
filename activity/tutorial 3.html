    <h1>Philosophy and Critical Thinking</h1>

    <p>Philosophy majors rank higher than all other majors on verbal and logical reasoning, according to <u>our new study</u> published in the Journal of the American Philosophical Association. They also tend to display more intellectual virtues such as curiosity and open-mindedness.</p>

    <p>Philosophers have <u>long claimed</u> that studying philosophy <u>sharpens one’s mind</u>. What sets philosophy apart is that it is not so much a body of knowledge as an activity – a form of inquiry. Doing philosophy involves trying to answer fundamental questions about humanity and the world we live in and subjecting proposed answers to critical scrutiny.</p>

    <p>It makes sense, then, that studying philosophy might make people better thinkers. But as <u>philosophers ourselves</u>, we wondered whether there is strong evidence for that claim.</p>

    <h2>Performance on Tests</h2>
    <p>Students who major in philosophy perform very well on tests such as the <u>Graduate Record Examination</u> and <u>School Admission Test</u>. Studies, including ours, found that people who have studied philosophy are, on average, <u>reflective and more open-minded</u>.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p><b>Public trust in higher education</b> has hit record lows in recent years, according to <u>polling by the Lumina Foundation and Gallup</u>. Meanwhile, the rapid advance of generative AI has <u>threatened the perceived value of a traditional college degree</u>.</p>

    <p>Yet now more than ever, students <u>must learn to think clearly and critically</u>. The stakes are more than personal: without citizens who can <u>reason through complex issues</u>, <u>democracy and civic life are at risk</u>.</p>

    <h2>What We Still Don’t Know</h2>
    <p>While our results point to real growth in students’ intellectual abilities, they do not capture everything philosophers mean by “intellectual virtue.” Intellectual virtue is not just a matter of abilities but of using them well: at the right times, for the right reasons, and in the right ways.</p>
